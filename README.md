# Seargo

This is a minimal metasearch engine for my personal usage.
While many mature metasearch engines exist, I prefer services that I self-host to be as lean as possible, which most available metasearch engines aren't.
The docker image for this project, and the memory usage under casual load is under **10MBs**, and that is important to me.
